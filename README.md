# Dyson Vacuum Adapter

Re-usable ziploc bags with a vent for a vacuum pump are great alternatives to traditional vacuum sealers. 
Evacuating such ziplocs with a hand pump is a bit tedious. Using a vaccum cleaner makes that a job of a very seconds. 
Here is an adapter for my Dyson hand vacuum cleaner for vacuuming suitable ziplock bags.

Make sure to print this with the flat side down and add adhesion using a brim.
